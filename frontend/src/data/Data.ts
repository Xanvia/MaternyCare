For babies, breast milk provides essential immune system support, reduces the risk of infections like earaches and respiratory illnesses, and promotes healthy weight gain. Breastfeeding also fosters emotional bonding between mother and baby through skin-to-skin contact and the release of oxytocin, a hormone that promotes feelings of love and attachment.
